Automation Workshops
======================

Here you will find workshops covering various automation topics, structured into levels per topic.

Aim
-----------------

The aim of these workshops is to cover the most common security automation topics encountered.

   * L100 is designed to give awareness of the subject matter, with simple hands-on exercises, to enable the learner to feel confident having introductory conversions regarding the topic.
   * L200 is designed to give more use cases for the topic, and to introduce commonly used industry tools, to enable the learner to see how the tools would be used outside of an academic or lab environment, in order to have more in-depth conversations regarding the topic.
   * L300 is designed to give further use cases of higher complexity, and also show how the relevant tools are operationalised, enabling the learner to be able to converse about their production deployments
